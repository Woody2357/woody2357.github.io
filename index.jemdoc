I am a second-year PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I have the privilege of being advised by [https://haizhaoyang.github.io Prof. Haizhao Yang]. I also work closely with [https://liangling98.github.io Prof. Ling Liang]. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Computational Mathematics from Wuhan University, under the guidance of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yFDDsVgAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Yuling Jiao] and [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SIJCkXcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao Prof. Xiliang Lu].  \n

I am interested in a wide range of topics related to applied mathematics and machine learning. Currently, my research focuses on *Bayesian statistics*, *optimization*, and *reinforcement learning*.
